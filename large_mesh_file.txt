Large Mesh File structure
- kd-tree structure
- mesh data and which nodes contains it
- settings for splitting:
	- max triangle/indices?
	- max depth

KDTreeNode:
- AABB bbox
- parent
- id
- child[2]
- data

data = BCF Mesh

Steps:
1. split the mesh into kdtreenodes
2. build buffers for them like BCFMesh
3. save the mesh first
4. save the node last, referring to mesh data

Splitting logic:
- collect triangles first
- now build the mesh data:
-- store unique verts
-- build new indices?

TODO:
- shrinkwrap child nodes (so initially no aabb for child node)
