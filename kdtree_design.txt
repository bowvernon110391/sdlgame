kd-tree algorithm:
- for each triangle:
-- find leaf node:
-- insert to that node


node-insertion logic:
- add
- if triangle_count > threshold && depth < limit:
-- split()
- else 
-- add to it :(


splitting logic:
- find splitting plane
- make left and right
- for each triangle in us:
-- pick most suitable node, and insert to that node
- clear our triangle vector
